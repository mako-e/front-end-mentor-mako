## Overview
Made this app with just HTML CSS and JS, not too crazy, but it was fun to do. Learned about how to use an API but need a lot more to learn about it. This was a Front End Mentor project, meaning there are thousands of solutions for this on the internet, this is mine, and is probably not the most optimal. 

### The challenge
Users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page (only the Dice for this case)
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon

## My process
- I did it with mobile-first principles, atleast from what I know, because it uses less CSS. I always start out with HTML, put the classes in, and then configure the css for the classes and html respectively. As for the css, I usually build my :root first with variables that will be used a lot, but for this one it's mostly just colors. 
  
### Built with
- Flex
- Mobile-first workflow
- Await API fetching

### What I learned
- I mostly learned about how to fetch API data. I am still a bit confused by the general structure but I'm sure I'll get the pattern once I get used to it.
