## My process
Like the other ones, I setup my html with classes, added the assets, then styled them with the mobile-first principle. However in this one, the mobile and desktop versions weren't so different so I didn't have to do too much for different looks on each.

### Built with
HTML and CSS. Still considering Tailwind but not sure yet, will get on that after I learn Vue.JS basics.
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I pretty much learned about hover effects in images, you basically need a relatively positioned parent, and an absolutely positioned hover div. Then with css you can modify the opacity of each during hovering. Im sure there are better ways maybe, but this works for now.

This is where you can give a hat tip to anyone who helped you out on this project. Perhaps you worked in a team or got some inspiration from someone else's solution. This is the perfect place to give them some credit.
